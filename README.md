The purpose of this project is to create a data model using a fact table and dimension tables, which can be useful for analyzing calorie burn patterns across different users, activities, and dates. Specifically:

Fact Table (calories burned data):
This table logs key metrics like Calories Burned and Duration for each record, tied to specific users, activities, and dates.
Dimension Tables:
Date Dimension: Contains detailed information about each date, such as the day of the week, month, and year.
Activity Dimension: Lists different types of activities like Running, Cycling, Yoga, etc.
User Dimension: Stores information about users, including gender and age.
By organizing the data in this way, the project enables efficient analysis of calorie-burning trends by different factors:

Date analysis (e.g., calorie burn patterns by day of the week or month).
User analysis (e.g., age and gender patterns in activity).
Activity analysis (e.g., which activities burn the most calories on average).
Saving these tables to an Excel file makes them easy to use for further analysis or reporting in tools like Excel, Power BI, or other BI platforms.


*** Witht this project the purpose is to showcase the Data storing undrestanding and stroy telling skills as the results are very unrliable since the data is generated automatically and not authentic.
